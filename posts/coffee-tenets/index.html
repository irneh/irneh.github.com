  <h3>Coffee Tenets</h3>
  <p>December  2, 2012</p>
  <p>I have a friend who works at a local coffee shop. Today he was telling me about some shops and restaurants he’d recently visited. One story was of a lady who serves nothing but chicken sandwiches. She’s open only around lunchtime but sells a few hundred of these $10 sandwiches each day. Another story was of a restaurant that essentially serves just specially poached eggs (the eggs are steamed). They too are successful and have a dedicated following. And then I was thinking of Unix.</p>
<p>A famous Unix precept is, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Mike_Gancarz:_The_UNIX_Philosophy">Make each program do one thing well</a>.” That’s what these shops were doing. All she makes is chicken sandwiches but hers are evidently done well enough they are worth standing in line to pay $10 for.</p>
<p>My friend continued. He has financing and is on his way to opening his own shop. He described some of the ways his shop will be different - some of the ways it will be, well, good. I listened, liking his ideas and before long was thinking of Unix again - or more specifically “<a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">Worse is Better</a>.” A gross simplification of Worse is Better might be to say these things matter, in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity</li>
<li>Correctness</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>Completeness</li>
</ul>
<p>There are close parallels between these principles and my friend’s goals. I’ll just describe #1, simplicity. My friend pointed to the page-long coffee menu beside us and said he’d start by cutting it down to just a handful of choices. That would make choosing easier. Also, he said when a new customer comes in the experience can be, well, challenging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer (C): Hi. Can I get a medium coffee?</li>
<li>Barista (B): Sure. Do you want a drip, French Press or pour-over?</li>
<li>C: Uh. OK. French Press.</li>
<li>B: Would you like our house blend or a single origin?</li>
<li>C: Single origin? Oh. Yeah. Let’s do that.</li>
<li>B: Would you like the Brazil, Ethiopian or Costa Rican?</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s not the end of it. My friend aims to make the ordering process simpler. We talked about other simplifications including behind-the-counter processes. In distinguishing between those processes and the customer interaction I made a mental parallel to distinguishing between software internals and external interfaces (e.g. API’s). That got me thinking again about <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">Worse is Better</a> and how it’s discussed there. The author states, “It is more important for the implementation to be simple than the interface.” In a coffee shop scenario the opposite may be true. It may be all-important to have a simple customer interface (interaction).</p>
<p>In the end I thought about Unix’s focus on portability, “Choose portability over efficiency.” Does that just mean, “For here or to go?” Ha, ha, no. Ahem.</p>
